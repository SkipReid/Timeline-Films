						<h2>Victorian Villains</h2>
						
						<p>Victorian Villains reveals for the first time, the fascinating photographs and compelling stories of the young Scots sent to prison in the 19th century. 
						Until the mid 1800&rsquo;s, the only records of young offenders were written accounts of their trials, but then a revolutionary new invention changed everything; 
						photography. By the 1870&rsquo;s every criminal – young and old, had their picture taken for police records, and many of these photographs still exist, giving us 
						a remarkable insight into the harsh reality of being a young Victorian in Scotland.</p>
						
						<p class="bot-margin-32">Using trial testimony, census records, and dramatic reconstruction to recreate the moment when these children&rsquo;s lives were changed 
						forever, we tell the stories of the &quot;young Victorian villains&quot; and the strict justice system that decided their fate. At the heart of the programme are 
						the powerful photographic images of these youngsters, which give a poignancy and authenticity to their stories, and bring their tales, quite literally, to life.</p>

						<h2>James Fleming 1877</h2>
						<p><strong>The true story of 13 year old James Fleming who tried to burn down the Industrial School he had been sent to.</strong></p>
						<p>In Victorian times, young orphans, beggars and vagrants would be sent to Industrial Schools to learn a trade, to try and stop poor 
						children falling into a life of crime. James did not however enjoy life in the Industrial School he was sent to and admits that he and 
						a friend tried to burn it down. James tells us how he and his accomplice George Fleming were caught and convicted of &quot;reckless fire raising&quot; 
						and as a result are to be sent to an even stricter institution – a reformatory school – for three years.</p>

						<h2>Jane Angus 1873</h2>
						<p><strong>The true story of 12 year old Jane Angus who was sent to prison and then Reformatory School after being caught stealing.</strong></p>
						<p>These strict residential schools were meant to teach young criminals a trade and stop them re-offending, and Jane gives us an insight into 
						what her daily routine at Reformatory is like.</p>
						<p>After spending 5 years at Reformatory School, Jane tells us how she was released, but then contracted Tuberculosis, known in Victorian times as 
						&quot;Consumption&quot; and a major killer at that time. Jane died in 1879 at the age of just 17.</p>

						<h2>John Smith 1876</h2>
						<p><strong>The true story of 14 year old farmer worker John Smith who found himself sent to prison for 6 months for forging a letter from his employer.</strong></p>
						<p>John gives us an insight into the kind of punishments which were frequently used in Victorian times. Picking oakham, being put to &quot;the crank,&quot; 
						being whipped and even being transported to Australia were all punishments that young criminals would have been subjected to in the 1800&rsquo;s.</p>
